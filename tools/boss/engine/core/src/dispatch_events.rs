//! Structured, file-backed log of every step in the dispatch
//! pipeline — `RequestExecution` ↦ pane bound to slot — so a silent
//! failure between any two stages can be diagnosed after the fact
//! without re-deriving state.
//!
//! The pipeline is described in detail in
//! [`engine-dispatch-instrumentation.md`]. This module is the
//! minimum production sink that the coordinator and spawn flow can
//! emit into today; downstream phases of that design (CLI verbs,
//! stage-stalled detector, topic broadcast) layer on top.
//!
//! Files live under the existing Boss state root so they survive
//! engine restarts and never share fate with `events.sock` (the
//! engine's *other* stream, which is itself one of the failure
//! modes operators may be diagnosing):
//!
//! ```text
//! boss-state-root/
//!   dispatch-events/
//!     current.jsonl            # source-of-truth flat stream
//!   executions/<execution-id>/
//!     dispatch.jsonl           # mirror of just this execution's lines
//! ```
//!
//! Writers are best-effort: a write that fails to land on disk logs
//! once via `tracing::warn!` and is dropped. Dispatch is never
//! blocked on event emission.
